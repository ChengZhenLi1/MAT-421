        "(b) the set of vectors is orthonormal is also a independent set. Because the by the property 1, each inner product of a vector is always 1, therefore, if the sum(or the linear combination) of the each vector multiply by a scalar is a 0 vector, then the salcar of each vector must be 0 to produce a 0 vector, which implies that the set is independent.\n",

Because u can be written as a linear combination of a scalar c_i times the vectors q_i. Then <u,q_i> is equivalent to the sum of c * q_i * q_i. Since it's a orthononormal set, then q_i * q_i is always 1, therefore c_i * q_i * q_i=c_i * 1=c_i. Therefore <u * q_i>= the sum of c_i. Therefore the sum of <u,q_i> * q_i= sum of c_i * q_i, which is the linear combination of the set {q_1, ... ,q_n}\n",
